# WAVE File Renderer

This is a suite of C programs that allow the user to read WAVE files into C arrays, generate simple audio waveforms (sine, square, saw), and then perform manipulations on these files such as an echo, or combining the waves into full songs.

## Usage

There are three main programs:

1. render_tone
2. render_song
3. render_echo
