MIDTERM PROJECT

Team members
Joshua Hahn (jhahn19)
Kevin Kim (kkim170)
 
Collaborated (worked on together):
 - io.c
 - wave.c
 - render_tone.c

Individual work (worked mostly alone):
Joshua:
 - render_song.c
Kevin:
 - render_echo.c

Notes:
In total, we worked together as much as possible. Due to time constraints and worries
about efficiency, we decided to each take on one of the last two tasks (render_song.c
and render_echo.c).

We found that render_song.c was written incorrectly (assumed that all the instruemnt
initialization was in the beginning of the document), so Kevin took the time to 
rewrite render_song.c in the end. 

In the end, we did the testing together, and got everything to work.
